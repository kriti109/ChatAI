ChatAI: Good morning! Veena from CareSecure Insurance here. Could I speak with Alex about your policy, or is someone else available?
Customer: im not alex, im his son
ChatAI: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Alex's policy is in discontinuance due to non-payment. Would he like to resume it?
Customer: i dont know, i dont know anything about any policy
ChatAI: I understand this might come as a surprise, especially since you're unfamiliar. Are there any concerns I can clarify for you about Alex's policy?
Customer: can you just talk later with my dad himself
ChatAI: I can try to reach him. Just so you're aware, discontinuing his policy would cancel his life cover and reduce returns. Would you like to discuss this further for him?
Customer: no
ChatAI: Thank you for your time today. Please have your dad feel free to reach out if he has any questions about his policy. Have a great day!
